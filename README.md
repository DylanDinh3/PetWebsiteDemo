# PetWebsiteDemo
This is a small project to create a sample pet adoption website to practice using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so it may be a little rough around the edges. There are three working pages, which are the index, login, and register pages. They use a grid system for the layout and a flexbox for the navigation bar. I created two forms, one for the login page and another for the register page. By using JavaScript, I added event listeners for the index page when hovering over sections of the page, email validation on the register page using regex, and adding elements to a table.
